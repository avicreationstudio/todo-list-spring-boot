# WELCOME TO SIMPLE TO DO LIST APP

---

MVC - Model View controller architecture

---

## Things we used

        Model      - refers to Database ( MySQL )
        View       - template engine ( Themeleaf )
        Controller - RESTAPI controller


# intro

- why express
- postman ?
- ACCOUNT CREATION:
  - <https://web.postman.co/>
  - create free account
  - Now account has be created
  - workspace > create workspace
    - Blank workspace
    - Only me (personal)
    - create new collection
- add request

## REST-API

- REST architecture
- separate API into logical resources
- Expose structured resource based urls
- use http methods (verbs)
- send data as JSON (usually)
- be stateless
- REST uses less bandwidth, simple and flexible making it more suitable for internet usage.
- It’s used to fetch or give some information from a web service.
- All communication done via REST API uses only HTTP request.

### HOW REST_API WORKS ?

- Working:
  - A request is sent from client to server in the form of a web URL as HTTP GET or POST or PUT or DELETE request.
  - After that, a response comes back from the server in the form of a resource which can be anything like HTML, XML, Image, or JSON.
  - But now JSON is the most popular format being used in Web Services.

In the context of Node.js, "packages" and "modules" refer to different aspects of organizing and distributing code, but they are closely related:

# BackEnd basics

- Client:
  - A device or software application that requests services or resources from a server.
  - Clients can range from personal computers, smartphones, tablets, to specialized hardware devices.
- Server:
  - A device or software application that provides services or resources to clients.
  - Servers are typically high-powered computers optimized for processing requests from multiple clients simultaneously.
- [client-server architecture]
 drawing
- Request:
  - A message sent by a client to a server, typically asking for access to a specific resource or service. Requests can take various forms, such as HTTP requests in web applications.
  - HTTP: Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
  - used to transfer HTML pages over network
- Response:
  - A message sent by a server to a client in reply to a request. Responses contain the requested data or indicate the outcome of the request (e.g., success, error).
- Protocol:
  - A set of rules and conventions that govern communication between clients and servers. Common protocols used in client-server architecture include
    - HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
    - TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)
- Statelessness:
  - In many client-server architectures, servers do not maintain information about the state of client sessions between requests. Each request from a client must contain all the information necessary for the server to fulfill the request. This simplifies server design and scalability but may require additional mechanisms for managing user sessions.
- Database:
  - A structured set of data stored and organized to support the operations, storage, retrieval, modification, and deletion of data.
- SQL database
  - They are table and row oriented. They Use SQL (structured query language) for shaping and manipulating data, which is very powerful. SQL database
  - example:
    - oracle
    - mysql
    - microsoft sql server
    - sqlite
    - Postgre sql
- NoSQL database
  - mongo db ( stored as document )
  - couch db ( stored as document )
  - firebase ( stored as document )
  - graphQL  ( stored as graphs )
  - neo4j    ( stored as graphs )
- API:
  - API (Application Programming Interface): A set of rules and protocols for building and interacting with software applications.
 API is a software interface that allows two applications to interact with each other without any user intervention.
- RESTful API:
  - An architectural style for designing networked applications, based on HTTP and the principles of REST (Representational State Transfer).
- Server-Side Frameworks:
  - Pre-written, standardized code that developers can use to streamline the development process, such as Django (Python), Ruby on Rails (Ruby), or Express.js (JavaScript), spring boot ( java )
- Authentication:
  - The process of verifying the identity of a user or system.
- Authorization:
  - The process of determining whether a user or system has permission to access a particular resource or perform a specific action.

# Types of api

- SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol):
  - SOAP is like sending a letter.
  - When you want to talk to someone,
  - you write a letter with all the details
  - and send it through the mail.
  - SOAP is an older technology.
- REST API :
  - REST : Representational State Transfer
  - API  : Application programming interface
  - With REST, information can be represented and transferred in different forms,
  - **application**:
    - get movies details using API.
- web socket
  - WebSockets are like having a phone call that stays open.
- client server architecture
  - **application**:
    - live chat application.
- WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication):
  - peer-to-peer protocol
  - **application**:
    - video Conferencing
    - google meet
